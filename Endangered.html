        <p>What are the most endangered animals in the world? The IUCN classifies nearly 4,000 species as critically endangered, meaning they face such severe threats that they could soon become extinct in the wild. This list includes 16 examples of the planet's most endangered animals, from birds, fish, and reptiles to marine and land mammals.
